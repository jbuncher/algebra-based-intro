Physics Concepts

- Vector components, addition and subtraction
- Equations of motion for constant acceleration
- Understand the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration
- Interpret plots of position, velocity, and acceleration for a variety of motions

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

You throw a heavy object off of a flat roof at an angle of approximately 45 degrees above the horizontal. Sketch the position, velocity and acceleration as a function of time in both the horizontal and vertical directions (this means you should have **6** plots!).

- How would these graphs change if the object was much less massive but you threw it with the same velocity? State the reason for any changes (or why they won't change), and sketch the new plots in a different color (on top of the old ones).

Simulation: 

- Check your understanding by trying to hit a target with a projectile fired at different angles. http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/projectile-motion
- Examine the velocity (green) and acceleration (blue) vectors for a particle in 2D. Run the linear and circular motion examples. http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/motion-2d
    - What happens to the velocity vector when the acceleration vector points in the same direction?
    - What happens to the velocity vector when the acceleration vector points in the opposite direction?
    - What happens to the velocity vector when the acceleration vector is perpendicular to the velocity vector?

## Basic Lab (B-level)

Using LoggerPro, analyze the motion of an object (insert movie "basketball shot"). 

- Produce graphs of the position, velocity and acceleration as a function of time in both the horizontal and vertical directions. 

- Find the horizontal velocity from position vs time graphs and compare to average velocity.
- Find the vertical acceleration from velocity vs time graphs and compare to average acceleration.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level) (Choose ONE)

- Graph the acceleration as a function of mass for a cart traveling down an incline. HINT: You will want to have at least 5 data points on a single plot.
- Pick another variable and determine how it affects an object's velocity, acceleration or position
- Use the "integration" feature to find the area under curve in some region of your acceleration plot. 
    - What are the units of this area? Explain why the area has these units.
    - What property of the velocity plot should the area match up with? Compare these two values, and do this for at least 5 regions!

- Use the "integration" feature to find the area under curve in some region of your velocity plot. 
    - What are the units of this area? Explain why the area has these units.
    - What property of the position plot should the area match up with? Compare these two values, and do this for at least 5 regions!

- Experimentally determine how a ball's horizontal and vertical velocities change after a bounce (use the video!)
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first)
