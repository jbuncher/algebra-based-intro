# Introduction

Tell me, and I will forget

Show me, and I may remember

Involve me, and I will understand 

- Confucious 450 b.c.



The lab is an extension of our classroom. The lab provides you with an arena where you are free to explore and familiarize yourself with the concepts we are learning. Some concepts will be encountered in lab prior to being covered in lecture, which may be different than you're used to. Exploring a concept in lab prior to the lecture has the advantage of giving you hands-on experience with a topic prior to hearing about it in lecture, "priming" your brain for understanding. It is your responsibility to read the appropriate sections in your text (or any outside resource). 

The lab is where you play and learn. We will get our hands "messy" in lab. However, the CBA lab format means that your brain has to come prepared and ready to work.

# Lab Structure

### **Schedule**

Instead of one 3 hour (marathon) lab session, your lab session is actually split into two smaller time slots. Hence you meet both Tuesday and Thursday for lab. The split lab time allows you to check your understanding (i.e. consult an outside resource), ask a question in lecture and minimizes fatigue (including hunger) that often occurs during a longer lab. You will have two time slots to finish each lab activity. It is really up to you and your lab group to set your schedule. You may work in a lab whenever there is not a regularly scheduled class present.

### **Individual Work**

You are expected to keep a lab journal (aka notebook). Lab journals do not have to be "official" lab books. Spiral bound notebooks or 3-ring binders can work very well. Your lab journal is your choice but whatever method you choose should keep you organized. 

You are responsible for all lab work. It is a good idea to save data and lab summaries on a personal electronic device (eg. USB drive). Hardcopy graphs can be saved (taped, stapled LoggerPro files can be saved and analyzed at a later time. You may install LoggerPro on your computer (our site license covers your personal use). See the instructor to borrow an installation disk. 

### **Equipment**

You will be using the universal lab interface (ULI) LabPro units with the LoggerPro software (version 3.8 or newer). Every lab station is equipped with basic equipment

- Motion Detector
- Force Sensors (2x)
- Carts (2x)
- Track with associated mounting equipment (stands etc.)
- Masses
- Scissors, markers, colored pencils, ruler and protractor

If you do not know how to use a particular piece of equipment consult the manuals (online), an instructor or another group. 

Clean up after yourself. This is a common courtesy – messy lab groups will have deductions taken from the whole group. 

## CBA labs 

There are three components to every lab:

| Level | Purpose | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C | Conceptual understanding | Conceptual Diagrams, Quantitative Relationships with Explanations – with group agreement on all of the above. |
| B | Basic Experimental measurement | Graph showing quantitative relationship(s) with written explanation. |
| A | (Advanced) Extended lab activity | Graph showing quantitative relationship(s) with written explanation. Note: Additional information about the relationship being analyzed may be needed. |

You and your lab group are checked and evaluated on your C-level lab during the first time slot. The C-level check consists of evaluating a lab journal (taken at random from group members) for correct diagrams and explanations along with and some additional questions given to group members. 

Group lab summaries are turned in for the B-level and A-level. Lab summaries are short – typically one page consisting of a graph with an explanation. A quality graph has

- appropriate labels and error bars 
- a best fit curve showing the trend or relationship between variables. 

A good explanation will include

- a 1-2 sentence description of what you did to get the plot (what experiment)
- a description of what the plot says/means
- what you expect the plot to look like, and
- why you expect the plot to look like it does (or why you expect it to look different)
- key words from the physics concepts being explored used in each of the above 3 points
- a discussion of how you assessed uncertainties in your measurements or calculations



A good lab summary does **not** need

- an introduction describing or discussing the purpose of the activity
- a section describing your measurement methods, though you may want to mention your methods (briefly!) when discussing your uncertainties

If summaries are turned in early you may resubmit corrected summaries to address instructor critiques (please attach the old summary to your new submission). 

You can always work on the B-level lab if it is taking time for an instructor to check your group for the C-level understanding. You need to complete all of the B-level activities – and address all of them in your group summary. You only have to complete a single A-level lab activity. The lab manual has suggestions for A-level activities but you may also propose and conduct your own investigation. Typically an advanced lab activity also involves more attention to error analysis..

### **Group Work**

Learning to work in a group is an important skill to develop. You will be working in a group (of typically three students) on your C-level and B-level lab activities. You may choose to work with a different group or alone when completing the (optional) A-level lab activity.  Your group will change during the semester. 

Remember that you can always consult other groups if you are stuck and need help. Do not wait for an instructor if you need help – go ask a group that looks like they know what is going on.

Lab Evaluation


Lab Evaluation

Each level will be graded on the following scale: 

The purpose of the lab summaries is to give you and your group prompt feedback. This lab structure allows gives you more control over your learning. 

- A group must receive a 3 at the C-level to receive credit for B-level work
- A student must receive a 2 at the B-level to receive credit for A-level work
- The lab score is weighted towards the C-level. For example, if you had a 4 on C-level, a 3 on B-level, and a 4 on A-level, your score would be 96%. If you had a 3 on C-level, a 4 on B-level, and a 4 on A-level, your score would be 94%.
- A-level activities often require time outside of lab to complete.
- There is no credit given for missed labs.
- You are expected to come to lab with a conceptual diagram and ideas already written in your lab journal. You will lose a C-level point if you are not prepared. 
- The percent lab score is given by [5\*(C)+3\*(B)+2\*(A)+42]/82 \*100%. The following table gives the calculated lab percentage given different points earned for the C-level, B-level and A-level lab components.

- Written response from all individuals (quick check); group oral questioning.
- Must work in assigned group.
- Must get at least a 3 on the C-level lab to get credit for any B-level or A-level work.

### B-Level (Done DURING Lab)

- Group summary of quantitative basic lab.
- Must work in assigned group.
- Must get at least a 2 on the B-level lab to get credit for any A-level work.

- May work with anyone (you do not need to work in your assigned group).
- An A-level activity can be a future B-level lab, or can be based on B-level results.

| 1 | Activity lacks purpose and focus. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Missing uncertainty in measured quantities (+/-) |
| 3 | Appropriate graph included (with error bars, labels and fit line). |
| 4 | Project investigates relevant physics. All elements correct with succinct (and correct) interpretation of physics (see above). |

# Lab Schedule

You will have two lab periods to complete every lab activity. Lab summaries are due at the start of the next scheduled lab period. When a lab is completed on a Tuesday the lab summary is due on Thursday and if a lab is completed on a Thursday the lab summary is due on the following Tuesday.

### Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

This week's lab is more of a "group modeling exercise" rather than a traditional lab. The focus is on estimation and modeling assumptions to arrive at a reasonable answer.

Humans need energy (we call it "food") to survive, and this energy has to come from somewhere. 

- Use an online calorie calculator (such as the one at http://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html ) to estimate your daily caloric need and:
  - record this number in your lab notebook
  - convert the number to Joules (really Joules / day)

Let's assume we have a technologically advanced device that can convert, with 100% efficiency, solar energy into your caloric energy. Find how much area you need to absorb the solar energy by:

- Looking up the term "insolation" (it's NOT the stuff that keeps your house warm), and finding a typical insolation value for the United States.
- Use the insolation value you found, along with your daily Caloric requirements, to find the area (in square-meters) needed by our technologically advanced device to convert enough solar energy to keep you "fed". Record this number in your lab notebook.

In preparation for B-Level, look up (using a textbook / journal article / good internet source):

- A typical value for the efficiency of photosynthesis for converting sunlight into biomass
- The term "trophic level", and "the 10% rule", and describe them

### Basic Lab (B-level)

In C-Level, you found the area necessary to harvest enough solar energy to "feed" you, assuming 100% of it could be converted to "food". Unfortunately, devices for converting solar energy into consumable energy (we call them "plants") are not nearly that efficient!

- Using the efficiency of photosynthesis you found in C-Level and the "10 % rule", find the new total area required to convert solar energy into plant energy into Caloric energy. 
- Our model so far assumes that we get to convert solar energy into plants year-round. Looking outside, this is not the case! Estimate how much more area you need to collect enough extra energy during the "growing season" to keep you fed year-round. Record this number in your lab notebook.

The next refinement to our model: we just assumed that you only eat plant-derived calories. We now need to modify this number to account for the meat/veggie split in your diet.

- Estimate the percentage of your calories that are animal-derived (meat, eggs, egg-based noodles, milk, fish) and the percentage that are plant-derived. These numbers should add to 1!
- Using these percentages, the ideas of "trophic levels" (the 10% rule), find the new area required to absorb enough solar energy to feed you!

Next Up – Go Big! We want to estimate the total population that the Earth can support using this model. Do this by:

- Averaging your areas with those of your group members to get a more representative value
- Finding (look it up!) the total amount of farmable land on the planet. This is sometimes called "arable" land, and you will likely have to convert the units to square meters.
- Use both your average and the total arable area to find the maximum number of people the Earth can support, and compare with the Earth's current population.

Uncertainties – Your estimate is most definitely an estimate, but that does not mean we can't estimate uncertainties. With your group, pick one aspect of the model (one of the assumptions) that you believe uncertainty will have the largest effect on your final number. Estimate the uncertainty, and change the assumption to the "smaller" end, and see how much your final area changes. What percent did your answer change by?

Modeling – While this exercise has very little of what most people associate with a "lab", it contains one of the most important pieces of the scientific process – quantitative modeling of a physical system. All new theories/models go through this process, and are then tested (much like your model in the Bone Lab). Humanity is currently carrying out one big experiment right now to test the validity of this model…..

### Advanced Lab (A-level)

- Identify at least 2 additional ways in which the model could be modified to be more accurate (and carry out estimations to arrive at a new number, along with uncertainties)
- List all assumptions that went into the final model, and identify any assumptions that may be inaccurate, either now or at some point in the future, and discuss the implications. It may help to consider the question we were answering: "What is the total global population sustainable by the Earth?" NOTE: Some of the assumptions were not explicitly listed in the lab!
