## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Larger animals, for excellent (physics!) reasons, have proportionally thicker bones than smaller animals. This goal of this lab is to help you understand why that is.

- Imagine that every dimension (length, width, and height) of an animal is doubled. How much would the force on one of the animal's legs (while standing at rest) increase by? HINT: Think of how the mass relates to the volume.
- If the bones scaled in the same way (length, width, and height are doubled), how much does the cross-sectional area of the bone increase by?
- Using your two previous answers, find how much the stress on the bone increases by when all of the dimensions of the animal are doubled
    - What if the animal's size is scaled up by 100 (such as from a mouse to an elephant)?
    - Why is this type of scaling problematic?

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

- Time to find a law for bone scaling! Several sizes of bones are available. Measure their length and diameter (don't forget to account for uncertainty).
- We want to investigate how the thickness of the bones changes when the size of the animal changes. What should you plot on the vertical and horizontal axes? Make this plot.
- What fits better, a linear model, or a power model? Compare with the results you expect from C-Level.

## Advanced/Extended Lab (A-Level) (DO ALL BULLET POINTS)

In the C-Level, you found that the bones of animals don't scale in the way you might think, and in the B-Level you found that the thickness of bones scales up more quickly than the length. In the A-Level, you will see how to derive the power law that relates the bone diameter to the bone length.

- If the stress is to stay the same when each dimension doubles, how much should the cross-sectional area of the bones increase by? Write your answer as $A_{new} = q * A_{old}$ , where $q$ is the value you are looking for. HINT: Set the "new" and "old" stress equal to each other, then write the "new" force (weight) in terms of the "old" force, and solve for Anew.
- Using your answer to the previous question, find how much the diameter of the bone increases by. You may find it useful to write the new area $A_{new}$ in terms of the new diameter $D_{new}$, and the old area $A_{old}$ in terms of the old diameter $D_{old}$.
- How much would the diameter need to increase by if, instead of each dimension doubling, each dimension was multiplied by a factor of $n$? Your answer should be an equation containing $D_{new} = ?$, where the $?$ contains $D_{old}$, $n$, and possibly some numbers.
- Using your previous answer, and the fact that $n$ tells you how much the length of the bone changed ($L_{new} = n * L_{old}$), substitute $L_{new}$ and $L_{old}$ in for $n$ to find how $D_{new}$ depends on $D_{old}$, $L_{old}$, and $L_{new}$.
- Compare the power law you just found with your experimental results from B-Level. Do they agree within uncertainties?
