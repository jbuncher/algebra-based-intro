# Springs and Things

| The wonderful thing about Tiggers 
| Is Tiggers are wonderful things 
| Their tops are made out of rubber 
| Their bottoms are made out of springs 
| They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy 
| Fun, fun, fun, fun, FUN!

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

You are given two identical springs (with spring constant k) and a mass (m).

- Imagine that both springs are attached to the mass side-by-side ("in parallel"), and the springs are attached to the ceiling with the mass hanging from them.
    - Draw a schematic diagram of the forces acting on the mass (don't forget labels!).
    - How much would each spring stretch? Write your answer as a number times how far the mass would stretch a single spring supporting its weight.
    - If you wanted to replace your two-spring combination with a single spring that stretched the same amount, how would the spring constant of your new spring compare with the spring constant of one of the original springs?
- Repeat the previous steps, but this time for the case where the springs are attached end-to-end ("in series") to the block and hung from the ceiling.

## Basic Lab (B-level)

Determine the spring constant of your spring using the following **three** different methods. You should end up with **three plots**

- Directly measure (such as with a ruler) the spring stretch as a function of applied force.
- Hang a mass from your spring and set the system oscillating. Use the force probe and motion detector to plot Force vs. Distance for the oscillating system.
- Plot x(t) for your oscillating spring-mass system. Find the period of oscillation and hence spring constant from a sinusoidal curve fit to the data. To relate the spring constant to the period of oscillation, you may want to look in the "Oscillations" chapter of your textbook.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level)

- Verify your C-level predictions about springs in parallel and series using your methods from B-level
- Experimentally determine how the period of the spring-mass system depends on the mass, and compare with the expected value.
- Experimentally determine how the period of the spring-mass system depends on the spring constant, and compare with the expected value.
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first).
